The prefabs in this folder are intended to be used with my other spaceships, e.g. Berlin Class 
Battlecruiser or Hindenburg Class Battleship.

These capital ships are two unity units big. The prefabs of the ships in this 
prefab folder are of a smaller sized ship class and therefore smaller than two unity units.

If you want to rescale the capital and smaller sized ships you can use the same rescale factor for
all ships.


If you want to use these models separately you should use the prefabs in the folder: 

			"PrefabsUnityDimensions"

The prefabs in the above mentioned folder are scaled bigger so that the model is two unity units big.
